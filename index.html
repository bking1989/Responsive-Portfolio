            <div id="picture"></div><p>My name is Bradley King, and I am an in-training web developer with experience in HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript (primarily jQuery). This is my portfolio, where you can find a collection of my past projects and my contact information.</p>
            <p>Although I am working in web development, now, I worked for a number of years in the insurance claims industry as an adjuster for rental car companies. I also attended four years of undergraduate studies at the George Washington University, in Washington, DC. I finished with a bachelor's degree in international affairs and political science, with an emphasis in comparative governments. Outside of work and education, I enjoy traveling, movies, video games (primarily on the PC), and photography.</p>
